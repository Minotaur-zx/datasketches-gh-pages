                <h3 class="margin-top-10">week 1 <span class="light-grey">|</span> data</h3>

                <p>I had a few choices for this month's topic of nostalgia and I didn't know which one would provide the most interesting dataset, so I actually scoured the web a while for all topics. I loved playing <i>Zelda</i>, but only on the Game boy variants, especially <i>Minish cap</i> & the <i>Oracle of Ages/Seasons</i> combo. There was something about the top view that worked exceptionally well for me, whereas in the 3D games I just kept falling off bridges and running into corners. But I couldn't find any interesting data. I looked at <i>Cardcaptor Sakura</i>, but only the manga. I was very happy to find out they are currently doing a new series! But there was actually too little data for me to build something elaborate with (if you're familiar with the manga, there are actually only about 19 cards she collects). <i>Neopets</i> is where I had my first HTML & CSS experience when I was 14 (although I completely dropped it again for 10 years after I got a boyfriend and went studying Astronomy üòÅ ). Since Neopets is now really only a ghost of what it was, and I found out my account was hacked and my pet stolen I wasn't in the mood to investigate that further. Which brings me to the last subject I had in mind: <i>Dragonball Z</i>. This anime was my very first introduction to the Japanese animation scene. Although I quickly turned solely to manga in general, I did stay loyal to DBZ and loved watching it all the way to the Fusion Saga (not sure why I stopped watching. I think I was just greatly annoyed by the Majin Buu & Gotenks character).</p>
                <a class="fancybox" href="data/nadieh/img/DBZ.jpg"> <img src="data/nadieh/img/DBZ_small.jpg" class="img-responsive img-month" alt="Dragonball Z"></a>

                <p>While randomly going through the extensive <a href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z" target="_new">Dragonball Wikia</a>, I learned that even though Dragonball Z was aired about 20 years ago, it's still very much alive. With <i>Dragonball Kai</i> now airing in the US, which is a filler-free version of Dragonball Z (and thus about 1/3 less episodes) and <i>Dragonball Super</i>, a brand new series taking place right after DBZ. I came across the page to each DBZ saga and saw a list all of the (major) fights that took place during that saga, in order. And that stuck immediately. It felt just so appropriate to the series to map out all of the fights that took place during DBZ; who fought who, was it anime only, any special conditions (say, fighting while in Super Saiyan "mode").</p>

                <p>So I manually went through all ¬±17 sagas that comprise the 291 episodes and copy-pasted the fights into Excel (yes I do use Excel from time to time to do highly manual stuff ^^). With the help of some Excel functions to split up the fights into the separate characters and 2 more hours of manual cleaning I had <a href="data/nadieh/Dragonball_Z_fights.xlsx" target="_new">a nice list of the 200 fights</a>; who fought and were they in a special state. However, I needed the data in a slightly different order. Right now, each fight was on 1 row, but I needed <i>each character</i> per fight on one row. And that's where R came in. I wrote <a href="data/nadieh/Reshape_DBZ_fight_data.R" target="_new">a tiny script</a> to loop through the Excel sheet and create <a href="data/nadieh/dragonball_Z_fight_per_person.csv" target="_new">the final dataset</a>.</p>

                <p>Another "data" gathering step that came up a bit later in the process, was finding appropriate animated gifs to highlight the most special moments and fights & nice shots of the main characters for a legend. I went through hundreds and hundreds of gifs & images, trying to find some decent stuff. But I also came across some wonderful funny gifs, short comics and images. Although not the funniest I saw, the two below belong to my favorites üòÜ  (I definitely discovered this month that I find Vegeta a way more interesting character than I used to).</p>
                <a class="fancybox" href="data/nadieh/img/DBZ_interesting_images.jpg"> <img src="data/nadieh/img/DBZ_interesting_images_small.png" class="img-responsive img-month" alt="Some funny DBZ images found on the web"></a>

                <h3>week 2 <span class="light-grey">|</span> sketches</h3>

                <p>I truly don't remember how I got the idea, but almost immediately after finding the <i>DBZ</i> fights information I had a concept in my mind of placing each fight on a line, one after another, where each saga in the series would have its own column. Lines would then be drawn through the fights from 1 character as if that person was flying from fight to fight. The image below shows my very first sketch of the idea. At the bottom of the image you can also see the sketch I made for Cardcaptor Sakura, because at that time I was still trying to figure out which topic might have the most interesting visual result.</p>
                <a class="fancybox" href="sketches/nadieh/DBZ_CCS_initial_sketches.jpg"> <img src="sketches/nadieh/DBZ_CCS_initial_sketches_small.jpg" class="img-responsive img-month" alt="The first sketch of the DBZ and Cardcaptor Sakura visuals"></a>

                <p>After deciding on <i>DBZ</i> I drew another image that was a bit more precise (below left). Since I already knew that I would have to create the formulas for the swooshing SVG paths myself I tried to see where to place the anchor points of the <a href="http://blogs.sitepointstatic.com/examples/tech/svg-curves/quadratic-curve.html" target="_new">SVG Quadratic B√©zier Curves</a> (which makes the lines <i>swoosh</i>).</p>
                <p>At first, I only looked at how to create the path from the first fight at the top through all other fights of the character all the way to the last fight at the bottom. This creates a path that you can stroke with a single width (there is no use filling the path, since it is not a closed path). Once I had that figured out, I looked at the result (which you can find in the <i>code</i> section below) and found a bit.... boring perhaps.</p>
                <p>Instead I was looking for a way to have lines with different widths, as if pressure was being used to draw them. So I created another simple sketch (below right) that had the shape that I was looking for. I then figured out the SVG path "formula" that would be needed. It was as if I was drawing the path from top to bottom twice, but the flipping the 2nd half, so it would run from bottom to top, completing an SVG shape that I could then fill instead of stroke. This 2nd part would be slightly, randomly, offset from the first to create the appearance of a line with different widths.</p>
                <a class="fancybox" href="sketches/nadieh/DBZ_sketch_investigating_arcs.png"> <img src="sketches/nadieh/DBZ_sketch_investigating_arcs_small.png" class="img-responsive img-month" alt="Investigating how to draw the arcs between fights"></a>

                <p>One part that I was constantly struggling with (well, I struggle with it practically every month) is the overall layout, the stuff <i>other</i> than the visual itself. What fonts would fit this design? How to place the intro text and any legends? How to make it look a bit interesting? I have to admit I'm still not very happy with the end result, but it's the best I could come up with üòû Maybe I just need to follow some layout design courses or something...</p>
                <a class="fancybox" href="sketches/nadieh/DBZ_sketch_intro_layout.jpg"> <img src="sketches/nadieh/DBZ_sketch_intro_layout_small.jpg" class="img-responsive img-month" alt="Drawing the layout of the intro section"></a>

                <p>As you can see, this month the sketches were very basic. It's really about getting the abstract shapes on paper. Any form of design was later done while I was already programming with the actual data.</p>

                <h3>week 3 & 4 <span class="light-grey">|</span> code</h3>

                <p>As per my sketches, I wanted to represent every fighter in a battle with a circle and then have these circles positioned partly overlapping. Also, each saga would be placed in its own column to make the distinction between different story lines more apparent. With some geometry that was achieved relatively quickly.</p>
                <a class="fancybox" href="code/nadieh/img-write-up/fights_per_saga.png"> <img src="code/nadieh/img-write-up/fights_per_saga_small.jpg" class="img-responsive img-month" alt="The very basic start of the visual"></a>

                <p>And then came the custom paths that would connect all the fights from one character. I only had the locations of a character's fights, so to create the swoosh I would have to figure out a way to position the anchor points of the <a href="http://blogs.sitepointstatic.com/examples/tech/svg-curves/quadratic-curve.html" target="_new">SVG Quadratic B√©zier Curves</a> myself to make it look nice. Of course, I didn't start by creating the complete path, I build things up in iterations, adding more and more of the needed complexity when the previous step is working. So I started with straight lines from fight to fight, then adding the anchor points at fixed locations, so all swooshes would look rather similar.</p>
                <a class="fancybox" href="code/nadieh/img-write-up/building_paths.png"> <img src="code/nadieh/img-write-up/building_paths_small_2.png" class="img-responsive img-month" alt="Several steps that show how the character paths were build"></a>

                <p>When I saw that fixed anchor points was creating a bit of a boring result, I added in bigger swooshes and randomness. The farther the distance between two fights, the farther out the anchor point is placed and each point also got a random "jitter" so that overlapping swooshes (characters going from the same fight to the next same fight) wouldn't overlap exactly. I liked the end result more, but still, in my mind the swooshing lines had a bit more going on by having different widths, from thin at the fight circles to broad during the bend between fights. Thus, as explained in the <i>sketch</i> section already, I turned the line from top to bottom into an entire closed path, by adding another section to the path string that would run from bottom to top. This second section would again be randomly offset from the first section on the anchor points, thus creating the appearance of different width lines. Naturally this didn't go right on the first try üòÅ</p>
                <a class="fancybox" href="code/nadieh/img-write-up/building_complete_paths_wrong.png"> <img src="code/nadieh/img-write-up/building_complete_paths_wrong.png" class="img-responsive img-month" alt="Figuring out how to create different-width paths"></a>

                <p>It was an interesting exercise, thinking about math and hand-crafted SVG paths, but in the end I finally had the result that I was looking for. Below left is the "before" image with only a stroked line and to right of it is the final result, where I've build the complete path and filled it with a color to give the appearance of a different-width line instead. I'd say the right looks more visually appealing ^^</p>
                <a class="fancybox" href="code/nadieh/img-write-up/comparing_swooshing_paths.png"> <img src="code/nadieh/img-write-up/comparing_swooshing_paths.png" class="img-responsive img-month" alt="Comparing before and after going from line to path"></a>

                <p>With about 200 fights, the visual was quite long, in fact it's about 6.5 times as long as it is wide. Thus it will never fit on any screen. And when I showed the visual to Shirley, she said that she'd like to know what section she's looking at with respect to the whole, and suggested I add a mini-map with a full overview.</p>
                <p>I knew it was a great idea, but I also sort of dreaded building it, haha. Nevertheless, one Saturday in January I sat behind my laptop for hours and slowly build up the mini-map. Actually getting the visual part in there wasn't the hardest challenge, it was figuring out the mathematics of when the mini-map should be fixed in place in the middle of the screen, or move up and down when you are outside of the chart area, hehe.</p>
                <a class="fancybox" href="code/nadieh/img-write-up/creating_mini_map.png"> <img src="code/nadieh/img-write-up/creating_mini_map.png" class="img-responsive img-month" alt="Creating a mini-map of the total visual on the right of the page"></a>

                <p>A suggestion by a designer friend was to try and make one (or all) of the swooshing paths look more like the "aura" that is typically visible when characters power-up. I tried a glow, but that made the visual exceptionally non-performing. So instead he said I should fill maybe 1 line with a pattern that would have some of the color differences present in the auras. As a test I made a simple SVG thing in Illustrator which I loaded as a pattern for Goku's swooshing line. However, I guess my design skills couldn't be stretched farther, because I could not make it look interesting enough to warrant the extra loading of a 0.5 - 1 Mb SVG file...</p>
                <a class="fancybox" href="code/nadieh/img-write-up/goku_line_background.png"> <img src="code/nadieh/img-write-up/goku_line_background_small.png" class="img-responsive img-month" alt="Trying out a pattern background for Goku's path"></a>

                <p>Another change that is visible above is that many of the swooshing lines are on the left side. This was a suggestion from Susie Lu, to make it easier to distinguish the good guys from the bad guys. So all the good guys have their lines on the left, whereas the bad guys are on the right. This made it possible to see that Vegeta starts out as a main antagonist, but turns to the good side (although maybe not for the right reasons, until he sacrifices himself in the Majin Buu saga üò¢)</p>

                <p>Personally, I particularly like the transition effect that occurs when you hover over a fight. With a white circle and everything getting bigger and the circles moving outward :) Besides that, the lines of the fighters and all the other battles in which any of the fighters appeared are highlighted in both the visual itself and the mini-map for context.</p>
                <a class="fancybox" href="code/nadieh/img-write-up/dbz_fight_hover.gif"> <img src="code/nadieh/img-write-up/dbz_fight_hover.gif" class="img-responsive img-month" alt="The transition effect when you hover over a fight"></a>

                <p>Due to having become a freelancer, this was the first month where I truly tracked my hours. Although I do feel that it was a particularly long month. I spend quite some time going trough gifs, finding the perfect ones, same for videos to link the gifs to and the character images. But also, 95% of the fights have annotations (if you hover over a fight) to explain what was special about that fight or how it fits into the story. These were all manual exercises, but they are that attention to detail that can make a true difference. But *drumroll* I spend about 75 hours on this visual üò± So for next month I really want to try and keep it within at least half that...</p>

                <p>You can find the final visual <a href="code/nadieh" target="_new">here</a>. It actually works the best in Chrome, due to its ability to handle CSS transitions better than the other browsers (even though I kept all transitions to either a change <i>transform</i> or <i>opacity</i> I keep creating visuals that have these "too-many-transitions-on-hover" issues which slows things down üòû)</p>

                <p>I have to admit, it was great fun to dive into a topic I hadn't really thought about for 15 years. It gave me a lot of enthusiasm to try and turn it into something worth looking at and informative!</p>

              <h3 class="margin-top-10">week 1 <span class="light-grey">|</span> data</h3>

              <p>
                Alright I'll be honest, I conned Nadieh into doing Nostalgia for this month just so I could finally have a month for Harry Potter.  Harry Potter (and Toy Story) will always have a special place in my heart: when the first movie came out, I was also 11 waiting for my Hogwarts letter.  I'm the same age as Emma and Daniel, and I grew up alongside them and their movies.  When the final movie came out in 2011, and the screen went to black and the theatre got up in a standing ovation, I had the distinct feeling that my childhood had ended.
              </p>

              <p>
                Having said all that (sentimental stuff), I went through a few different ideas before ending up on my current; at first, I was thinking of doing something on Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, since I had just seen it in December, but then realized that there were probably copyright issues to the script.  I then bought a Marauder's Map hoping to visualize that somehow, but got stuck trying to figure out what kind of data I could extract from it.  And then one day I suddenly remembered my original November Harry Potter idea to scrape fan fiction and graph fan reactions to the movies and books.
              </p>

              <p>
                I first got into fanfiction in middle school, when my friend showed me the first six episodes of <em>Fruits Basket</em>, but then couldn't get our hands on the rest of the episodes and needed a fix and found <a href='https://www.fanfiction.net/' target='_new'>fanfiction.net</a> instead.  I then went on to <em>Cardcaptor Sakura</em> (SxS 4EVA), and finally to <em>Harry Potter</em> in my high school years.  (The year I realized that I couldn't get into any of the new fanfiction being written because the grammar and plot were just too horrible, I realized I had "grown up" and wished dearly for my childhood back.)
              </p>

              <p>
                For this data, I decided to scrape <a href='harrypotterfanfiction.com/storysearch.php?&srt=1&sctlab=1' target='_new'>harrypotterfanfiction.com</a> instead, because it had less stories (~80k vs. fanfiction.net's ~730k) and because it had better metadata (it has not only genres and characters, but also era and pairing).  I used <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/html2json' target='_new'>html2json</a> to turn the page response into JSON, and wrote a (really brittle) <a href='https://github.com/sxywu/hpff/blob/master/data/scraper.js' target='_new'>parser to get each story and its metadata</a>.  I was worried that the hpff servers might time me out requesting ~3300 pages from them, but it seemed that my (brittle, synchronous) code took just enough seconds between each page that I had no such problems.
              </p>

              <p>
                A quick first look at the data already proved interesting:
                <a class="fancybox" href="data/shirley/years.png"> <img src="data/shirley/years.png" class="img-responsive img-month"></a>
                These are numbers by story publish year, which means that Harry potter fanfiction spiked in 2007 (when the final book and 5th movie came out) but have been dwindling to seriously sad numbers since.  Here's another one:
                <a class="fancybox" href="data/shirley/pairings.png"> <img src="data/shirley/pairings.png" class="img-responsive img-month"></a>
                Draco/Hermione is the top non-canon ship, which doesn't surprise me at all (I have this theory that the whole Draco/Hermione thing really took off after the third movie when Hermione punched Draco in the face.  Great scene.)
              </p>

              <h3>week 2 <span class="light-grey">|</span> sketches</h3>

              <p>
                <a class="fancybox" href="sketches/shirley/Sketch1.jpg"> <img src="sketches/shirley/Sketch1.jpg" class="img-responsive img-month"></a>
                I started this month's sketches as I try to for most months since the disastrous lesson of September, and wrote down all the data I had gathered.  From there, I identified genres, eras, and pairings as the potentially most interesting, and jotted down my questions for the data.
              </p>

              <p>
                The question that really stuck was: which pairings were the most popular, and which pairings did they co-occur with?  Who did a character get paired with the most?  So the first idea I had was to do a timeline of stories with the specific character, and then overlap whoever the character was paired with on top of the timeline; that's what this awkward part of the previous sketch was:

                It was around then that <a href='https://pudding.cool/' target='_new'>The Pudding</a> came out with their <a href='https://pudding.cool/2017/01/shape-of-slavery/' target='_new'>Shape of Slavery</a> piece, and I really loved how they used both the size and color of circles to encode two dimensions (population, and percent of population that were slaves) over a map:
                <a class="fancybox" href="sketches/shirley/pudding_slavery.png"> <img src="sketches/shirley/pudding_slavery.png" class="img-responsive img-month"></a>
                And I was inspired to try something similar:
                <a class="fancybox" href="sketches/shirley/Sketch1-3.jpg"> <img src="sketches/shirley/Sketch1-3.jpg" class="img-responsive img-month"></a>
                So the circles would encode number of stories up to 100, and the color would indicate the number of reviews for those 100 stories.  I wanted to put the circles over a timeline, and also in matrix form:
                <a class="fancybox" href="sketches/shirley/timeline_matrix.png"> <img src="sketches/shirley/timeline_matrix.png" class="img-responsive img-month"></a>
                The timeline looked quite good, but the matrix (which was basically characters on both axis, and the circles indicated stories that had that pairing) didn't as much.  So I decided to keep the timeline, but was back to the drawing board in terms of what other visuals I wanted to use to explore the data.
              </p>

              <p>
                This was also around when I hung out with <a href='http://infowetrust.com/' target='_new'>RJ Andrews</a> and <a href='http://catherinemaddenrelay.com/' target='_new'>Catherine Madden</a> for an afternoon, and two beautiful things (amongst many) came out that day.
              </p>

              <p>
                The first was that RJ gave me my angle for the month: how do canon and non-canon ships compare in popularity?  So I re-thought all of my visuals to be around that (that's RJ's scribbles at the bottom left, hehe):
                <a class="fancybox" href="sketches/shirley/Sketch2.jpg"> <img src="sketches/shirley/Sketch2.jpg" class="img-responsive img-month"></a>
                And this is the part of the sketch I decided to use:
                <a class="fancybox" href="sketches/shirley/Sketch2-2.jpg"> <img src="sketches/shirley/Sketch2-2.jpg" class="img-responsive img-month"></a>
              </p>

              <p>
                And the second was that Catherine drew me these gorgeous illustrations of the top 20 Harry Potter characters:
                <a class="fancybox" href="sketches/shirley/illustrations.png"> <img src="sketches/shirley/illustrations.png" class="img-responsive img-month"></a>
                (And she was so amazingly fast and I'm so in love them they're so pretty and she did them in only a few hours...!!)
              </p>

              <h3>week 3 & 4 <span class="light-grey">|</span> code</h3>

              <p>
                I think this month's hard part was mainly in the ideation, and after that, the coding was pretty straight going.  It only took me as long as it did (2 weeks after finally settling on a good layout) because I cared too much.  And what I mean by that is because I'm so invested in Harry Potter, I really wanted to make a good visualization that would do it justice.
              </p>

              <p>
                <a class="fancybox" href="code/shirley/gifs.png"> <img src="code/shirley/gifs.png" class="img-responsive img-month"></a>
                The first thing I did was add book and film dates to my timeline (the above is that of Harry/Ginny stories), as well as gifs to give context (though let's be real, it's mostly just because I saw Nadieh add gifs and I wanted to procrastinate by looking for Harry Potter gifs).  The book and film dates did give great context though, especially the very interesting spikes between the 6th and 7th books.  My first guess for those spikes were that there were a lot of anticipation for the last book, but upon closer inspection, there's always a spike in the number of stories published around December and January because of the holidays.  (I couldn't figure out the March 2006 spike though...)
              </p>

              <p>
                I then started looking into how I wanted to depict several pairings for a character:
                <a class="fancybox" href="code/shirley/area.png"> <img src="code/shirley/area.png" class="img-responsive img-month"></a>
                The above is a set of area charts showing Hermione and her pairing's stories by publish date.
                (Believe it or not, that's the first time I've ever used <a href='https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#areas' target='_new'>d3.area</a>, though I've used <a href='https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#lines' target='_new'>d3.line</a> many times, and I quite liked the look.)  There are 6 charts overlapping each other in total, which, while pretty, made it hard to distinguish any trends.  I then tried stacking the area charts, and found it to be slightly easier to read:
                <a class="fancybox" href="code/shirley/stacked_area.png"> <img src="code/shirley/stacked_area.png" class="img-responsive img-month"></a>
                But it was still hard to make out the top most areas, the pairings with the least stories that blended into each other for most of the months.  I played around with a few of the <a href='https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#curves' target='_new'>curve options</a> (how to interpolate between the points in an area/line chart), and ultimately landed on <a href='https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#curveStep' target='_new'>d3.curveStep</a>:
                <a class="fancybox" href="code/shirley/stacked_step_area.png"> <img src="code/shirley/stacked_step_area.png" class="img-responsive img-month"></a>
                Though it has its downside (when the lines are too close together, it's hard to tell where one ends the next starts), I still liked it the most for how clean it looked.
              </p>

              <p>
                Other then the stacked area chart timeline, I also had to figure out how to show the genres for each pairing.  The genres were important to me, because I wanted to see if specific pairings leaned heavier towards specific genres, and it turns out that they do; for example, Hermione/Ron stories tend to lean towards Drama, Fluff, and Humor, while top Hermione/Draco genres are Drama and Angst, with two or three times more in the Horror/Dark genre than all of Hermione's other pairings.  James/Lily's top genre is actually Humor, closely followed by Drama, while Harry/Ginny's top genres are Drama and Action/Adventure.
              </p>

              <p>
                To show all this, I at first considered showing the cumulative number of stories for each genre, colored and placed according to how dark/serious or light/fluffy it was:
                <a class="fancybox" href="code/shirley/genres_sketch.jpg"> <img src="code/shirley/genres_sketch.jpg" class="img-responsive img-month"></a>
                But I was also interested in seeing if specific genres rose or fell because of occurrences in the books or films, and in the end decided to make it a timeline also (though I do wonder if my darker/lighter spectrum idea would have been more interesting):
                <a class="fancybox" href="code/shirley/genres.png"> <img src="code/shirley/genres.png" class="img-responsive img-month"></a>
                And I lined them up with my original timeline for the pairing colored by reviews:
                <a class="fancybox" href="code/shirley/reviews_genres.png"> <img src="code/shirley/reviews_genres.png" class="img-responsive img-month"></a>
              </p>

              <p>
                Finally, I put in the graph of characters linked by their pairings, which was also the way for users to select which character's stories to explore (it defaulted to Hermione who had the most Romance stories written for her):
                <a class="fancybox" href="code/shirley/graph.png"> <img src="code/shirley/graph.png" class="img-responsive img-month"></a>
              </p>

              <p>
                Some legends, intros, and footers later, my Harry Potter visualization was finally ready:
                <a href="http://sxywu.com/hpff" target='_new'> <img src="code/shirley/final.png" class="img-responsive img-month"></a>
                I really like the look of the whole piece and how it turned out (no doubt made much better by Catherine's character illustrations), but I feel mixed about the fact every visual was a timeline.  On one hand, I like that they were different takes on the same timeline, but I also wonder if I should have changed up the visuals to break up the monotony.  But if there's one thing I'm for sure happy about, it's that I managed to do this whole piece with gradients of only two colors: pink and purple.  I've been noticing that I'm quite over-reliant on color in my visuals, and had been wondering how I could remedy that, and I really like how this piece turned out in that context.
              </p>

                <p><img alt="Snapshot of final project" class="img-responsive" src="code/guest/header.png" /></p>
                <p>When Shirley and Nadieh asked me to make a guest post for Data Sketches, I jumped at the opportunity but immediately panicked a little because I had agreed to the daunting task of creating something like their wonderful projects over the past six months. Whether or not that happened will be left to the reader but below is the story of how it came to be.</p>

                <h3>year 1 <span class="light-grey">|</span> data</h3>

                <p>Unlike many of my projects, I didn't need to start by collecting data because I had already done so...three years ago. Maybe I knew one day I would do more with it. Back in 2013, when I just started getting seriously interested in the artistic side of data visualization, I did what any newly-obsessed data junky would do: I picked a familiar subject and tracked it obsessively.</p>
                <p>Taking a step back, it's important to mention that I play a lot of Scrabble. The game has been part of my family since before I was. My grandmother has is a force to be reckoned with in the game, my father has played for ages, and both of them taught me when I was about 12 as a way to build my language and math skills. (My father was an English teacher and I was always the scorekeeper.) They never let me win and for that I'm thankful but during the early years, they were formidable opponents&mdash;and still are!</p>
                <p>Fast forward to 2013. I decided to track the weekly games with my father&mdash;hoping to chart our scores and find interesting patterns in our playing styles. After each game, I diligently entered the score data into my own MySQL database to query and generate a bare bones dashboard.</p>
                <p><a class="fancybox" href="data/guest/database.png"><img alt="Screenshot of Scrabble database" class="img-responsive img-month" src="data/guest/database.png" /></a></p>
                <p><a class="fancybox" href="data/guest/early-dashboard.png"><img alt="Screenshot of original dashboard" class="img-responsive img-month" src="data/guest/early-dashboard.png" /></a></p>
                <p>I wish I had the foresight to track which words were played and did so for the first two games of 2014 but lost motivation because I was prolonging each game by pausing after each turn to record which word was played, where it was played, and how many points it was worth. I did take a few pictures of the final boards though:</p>
                <p><a class="fancybox" href="data/guest/game-boards.jpg"><img alt="Photo of a few final Scrabble boards" class="img-responsive img-month" src="data/guest/game-boards.jpg" /></a></p>

                <h3>days 1 and 2 <span class="light-grey">|</span> &ldquo;sketching&rdquo;</h3>

                <p>The day I was asked to work on a project about nostalgia, one of my first thoughts was that Scrabble dataset. It was personal, made me think of good times, and was detailed enough to generate some interesting results.</p>
                <p>My goal was to explore the variety of points earned in each turn rather than who won or lost. I enjoy working with more experimental ways of visualizing data than creating graphics that strictly inform&mdash;though I do enjoy a well-made chart.</p>
                <p>I've never felt sketching out ideas on paper worked for me. I enjoy seeing others&rsquo; sketches and have nothing against it but I do most &ldquo;sketching&rdquo; in my mind and feel sketching on paper slows me down. I enjoy brainstorming with real data&mdash;either a sample or the full set&mdash;to see if my ideas are realistic before polishing them. <a href="https://www.nodebox.net/">NodeBox</a> is great for this because I don't get bogged down with coding and I can see instant results after creating a few nodes to manipulate the data. <a href="http://raw.densitydesign.org/">Density Design's Raw</a> is another tool I frequently use. With every new idea that pops in my head, I save a new version so my &ldquo;sketches&rdquo; are reusable and adjustable if I want to examine a new direction based on an earlier version.</p>
                <p><a class="fancybox" href="sketches/guest/version-files.png"><img alt="Screenshot of file versions" class="img-responsive img-month" src="sketches/guest/version-files.png" /></a></p>
                <p>My first idea was to take the turn-by-turn step charts from my original dashboard and overlap them to see if any general trends emerged beyond the obvious. Seeing the result was personally satisfying but not very visually interesting. I left it be without bothering to add the steps.</p>
                <p><a class="fancybox" href="sketches/guest/scrabble-1.png"><img alt="First version" class="img-responsive img-month" src="sketches/guest/scrabble-1.png" /></a></p>
                <p>Next, I wanted to see exactly when I played Scrabble throughout the year so I made an ugly but informative "date wheel" just showing dates of each game. I was surprised to see the large gaps since I thought we played just about every week. Some were expected like when I took vacations with family but the two in late winter/early spring were unexpected. I think those gaps were when my father was traveling at conferences or visiting friends.</p>
                <p><a class="fancybox" href="sketches/guest/scrabble-2.png"><img alt="Second version" class="img-responsive img-month" src="sketches/guest/scrabble-2.png" /></a></p>
                <p>The next logical step was to combine the first two sketches and see the turn-by-turn charts on the date wheel. The image below shows that but confused me at first because the gaps weren't in the same spots as before. Then I realized that the lines weren't straight but angled at about 45 degrees from each point&mdash;so they were in the correct spots but the angles shifted the gaps. This version reminded me of those <a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=plasma+globe">plasma globe toys</a>.</p>
                <p><a class="fancybox" href="sketches/guest/scrabble-3.png"><img alt="Third version" class="img-responsive img-month" src="sketches/guest/scrabble-3.png" /></a></p>
                <p>Differentiating games from one another was difficult so I created straight spokes around the wheel with circles representing each turn, color-coded by player and sized based on how many points were earned. Distance from the center corresponded to which turn was played (first turn closest to the center, last turn farthest). The results were genuinely interesting but reminded me too much of a previous project I created so I didn't pursue it much. The gaps for when I didn't play also started to get distracting.</p>
                <p><a class="fancybox" href="sketches/guest/scrabble-4.png"><img alt="Fourth version" class="img-responsive img-month" src="sketches/guest/scrabble-4.png" /></a></p>
                <p>However, creating this version resulted in a reusable setup for NodeBox for parsing my data using network nodes. Using a single flat dataset, I could now easily parse each game, each player, and each turn.</p>
                <p><a class="fancybox" href="sketches/guest/scrabble-4-nodebox.png"><img alt="NodeBox configuration for fourth version" class="img-responsive img-month" src="sketches/guest/scrabble-4-nodebox.png" /></a></p>
                <p>Once I had a reusable setup, I quickly created a version of the charts from my original dashboard just to see if I could. Without adding steps, the result was lots of wiggly lines. I would eventually come back to this version occasionally to play with this more.</p>
                <p><a class="fancybox" href="sketches/guest/scrabble-5.png"><img alt="Fifth version" class="img-responsive img-month" src="sketches/guest/scrabble-5.png" /></a></p>
                <p>Looking for a different approach, I created plainer design focusing on the process of inching toward a final score. This version showed each game as a group of horizontal lines with dots spaced out based on the points earned during each turn. I liked the relative even distribution but it was too busy and difficult to differentiate games and even players.</p>
                <p><a class="fancybox" href="sketches/guest/scrabble-6.png"><img alt="Sixth version" class="img-responsive img-month" src="sketches/guest/scrabble-6.png" /></a></p>
                <p>The next version is where I finally started seeing potential. Instead of fitting all turns from all games on a single spoked wheel, I created separate spoked wheels for each game. Each turn is a spoke and reading clockwise from the top, a dot color-coded by player is positioned farther from the center the more points were earned. I really liked seeing the wide variety of each game and where big plays were made&mdash;likely with bingos (playing all seven tiles at once in a turn). This would eventually become the basis for one of the final visuals.</p>
                <p><a class="fancybox" href="sketches/guest/scrabble-7.png"><img alt="Seventh version" class="img-responsive img-month" src="sketches/guest/scrabble-7.png" /></a></p>
                <p>Still looking for more ideas, I decided to try an idea based on <a href="http://www.stefanieposavec.co.uk/writing-without-words/">Stephanie Posavec's Writing Without Words project</a> where wandering paths were created by drawing lines between points following a simple algorithm: draw a line for the first turn based on points earned, turn 90 degrees, and draw another and repeat. I loved this idea when I first saw Stephanie's project. It can be easily applied to so many topics with fascinating results. Applying it to Scrabble games produced very fun results and I decided to use them in one of the final visuals.</p>
                <p><a class="fancybox" href="sketches/guest/scrabble-8.png"><img alt="Eighth version" class="img-responsive img-month" src="sketches/guest/scrabble-8.png" /></a></p>
                <p>In an attempt to build on the wandering paths, created a quick-and-dirty variation that drew lines based on a ping-pong like algorithm: draw a line pointing left or right and alternate between the two moving up with every turn. The results weren't great but I saved the idea nonetheless.</p>
                <p><a class="fancybox" href="sketches/guest/scrabble-9.png"><img alt="Ninth version" class="img-responsive img-month" src="sketches/guest/scrabble-9.png" /></a></p>
                <p>After feeling a little maxed out with NodeBox, I threw the data into <a href="http://raw.densitydesign.org/">Raw</a> to see what there was to see. I created a couple treemaps of points per game color-coded on a linear scale and color-coded by player. I also created a bump chart showing ranking of players for the entire year.</p>
                <p><a class="fancybox" href="sketches/guest/treemaps.png"><img alt="Treemaps" class="img-responsive img-month" src="sketches/guest/treemaps.png" /></a></p>
                <p><a class="fancybox" href="sketches/guest/bumpchart.png"><img alt="" class="img-responsive img-month" src="sketches/guest/bumpchart.png" /></a></p>

                <h3>day 3 <span class="light-grey">|</span> polishing and code</h3>

                <p>I knew I wanted to use the spoked wheel design so I experimented with different ways of trying to combine them into one giant graphic resembling fireworks. I also started playing with different color ideas. In these combinations, the distance from the common baseline of an entire game is based on how many total points were earned that game. (More points = farther from baseline.)</p>
                <p>NodeBox has a node for creating stars and just for fun, I replaced the dots with stars and configured the number of points on the star to correspond to the number of points earned on a turn, which resulted in a fuzzy appearance. It was a little silly but I liked it.</p>
                <p><a class="fancybox" href="code/guest/scrabble-10-11-12.png"><img alt="Versions 10, 11, and 12" class="img-responsive img-month" src="code/guest/scrabble-10-11-12.png" /></a></p>
                <p>The more I played with a giant graphic, the more I realized that while it was appealing in theory, the details were lost and there was too many overlapping points&mdash;even when using a horizontal baseline instead of a radial one.</p>
                <p>I wanted to find a different way of arranging the games and remembered that for an earlier project, I found <a href="http://hydra.nat.uni-magdeburg.de/packing/">Packomania</a> when looking for a way to tightly arrange circles in a specific shape. This site offers a mindboggling number of diagrams showing how circles of varying or consistent sizes can be packed into squares, circles, and other shapes when the number of circles from just a few to over two thousand. The best part is that each diagram is available in a PDF with the original vector shapes. This is an incredibly valuable resource for people like me who don't feel like coding packing algorithms.</p>
                <p><a class="fancybox" href="code/guest/packomania.png"><img alt="Sample Packomania diagrams" class="img-responsive img-month" src="code/guest/packomania.png" /></a></p>
                <p>NodeBox supports importing SVGs so it's possible to use one of these diagrams to use as a guide for placing shapes. Here's the general process:</p>

                <ol style="text-align: left;">
                    <li>Download a PDF of a diagram with the appropriate number of shapes. In my case, found diagrams with 47 circles for the 47 games I played.</li>
                    <li>Open the PDF in Illustrator and extract just the circles&mdash;removing all other shapes.</li>
                    <li>Reorder the shape objects in the order they should be parsed by NodeBox: first at the bottom, last at the top. In my case, the first corresponded to the first game I played in 2013.</li>
                    <li>Export the file as an SVG.</li>
                    <li>Use the import SVG node in NodeBox to import the SVG, connect it to an ungroup node and connect that to a centroid node. This finds the center points of each circle which can be used to position shapes.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>At this point, it was just a matter of finding a symmetrical arrangement of 47 circles that I liked and that would fit well on a screen. After manually moving circles around in Illustrator for longer than I care to admit, I found a good arrangement. I also used the connect node to draw a faint line connecting all the centroids to illustrate the path from beginning of the year to the end. The same arrangement was used for both main visuals.</p>
                <p>Below are the NodeBox configurations for the two main visuals.</p>

                <p>I knew I wanted to keep the original stepped line charts for a more analytical view of how games unfold as a type of appendix. These were created with <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/">Highcharts</a>. Highcharts is my go-to tool for creating charts because it's relatively easy for me to use and I can focus more on how the charts look without worrying how they work under the hood. I really enjoy customizing the options to configure the colors, data, how they behave, and more&mdash;mostly because its documentation is some of the best I've seen with good explanations, easy navigation, and working examples of almost every option.</p>

                <h3>reflections</h3>

                <p>The <a href="http://www.c82.net/scrabble">final result</a> is a visual experiment of one of many years of Scrabble that I hold dear. I can't remember every game I've played but looking at the visuals helps me remember the excitement of surging ahead with a bingo or the slogging along with a rack full of vowels playing turns worth only a few points.</p>
                <p>Analyzing these games has helped me fondly remember a time when I looked forward to my weekly visit with my parents to have dinner and play a good game of Scrabble. Geography may separate us now but I still play with my father twice a week and we're still just as dedicated to the game as we ever were.</p>
